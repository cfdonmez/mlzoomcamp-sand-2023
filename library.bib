  abstract={Non terrestrial networks (NTN) involving ‘in the sky’ objects such as low-earth orbit satellites, high altitude platform systems (HAPs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be integral components of next generation cellular systems. With the deployment of 5G services and beyond, NTNs are leveraged to assist as aerial base stations in providing ubiquitous network connectivity and service to ground users or be deployed as aerial users connected to the cellular network. NTN-aided wireless communication offers multiple benefits such as mobility, flexibility, resistance to ground physical attacks and wide coverage. However, due to their limited resources and the current design of terrestrial cellular systems that do not account for aerial users, and other restrictions such as service requirements, limited available power and storage resources on high-throughput satellites, resource allocation, location of the high altitude platform base station and the flight trajectory of the UAVs need to be intelligently controlled to satisfy various objectives both from an aerial base station and overall network perspectives. To achieve this, many works have explored Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to allow aerial platforms in non-terrestrial networks to learn from past observations and achieve some optimal control policy. In this paper and differently from prior surveys, we contribute a comprehensive review of the control objectives required by non-terrestrial platforms that have been solved using RL formulations. We provide an up-to-date overview of the latest applications of RL techniques for different NTN-aided wireless communication aspects. The survey focuses on Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulations in terms of states, actions, and rewards. We synthesize a taxonomy from the surveyed literature and provide a comprehensive representation of the current usages of RL in NTN-aided wireless communications. A qualitative analysis of the level of realism achieved in the works presented in the literature is provided based on several factors that pertain to the simulation environment, station deployment setting, wireless channel assumption, and energy considerations. We also curate a list of challenges that remain to be considered by the research community in order to achieve more efficient deployments and close the simulation-to-reality gap.},

  title={Latency Versus Transmission Power Trade-Off in Free-Space Optical (FSO) Satellite Networks With Multiple Inter-Continental Connections},

  abstract={In free-space optical satellite networks (FSOSNs), satellites connected via laser inter-satellite links (LISLs), latency is a critical factor, especially for long-distance inter-continental connections. Since satellites depend on solar panels for power supply, power consumption is also a vital factor. We investigate the minimization of total network latency (i.e., the sum of the network latencies of all inter-continental connections in a time slot) in a realistic model of a FSOSN, the latest version of the Starlink Phase 1 Version 3 constellation. We develop mathematical formulations of the total network latency over different LISL ranges and different satellite transmission power constraints for multiple simultaneous inter-continental connections. We use practical system models for calculating network latency and satellite optical link transmission power, and we formulate the problem as a binary integer linear program. The results reveal that, for satellite transmission power limits set at 0.5 W, 0.3 W, and 0.1 W, the average total network latency for all five inter-continental connections studied in this work levels off at 339 ms, 361 ms, and 542 ms, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding LISL ranges required to achieve these average total network latency values are 4500 km, 3000 km, and 1731 km, respectively. Different limitations on satellite transmission power exhibit varying effects on average total network latency (over 100 time slots), and they also induce differing changes in the corresponding LISL ranges. In the absence of satellite transmission power constraints, as the LISL range extends from the minimum feasible range of 1575 km to the maximum feasible range of 5016 km, the average total network latency decreases from 589 ms to 311 ms.},

  abstract={Recent studies have shown that satellite communication (SatCom) will have a fundamental role in the next generation non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In SatCom, radio frequency (RF) or free-space optical (FSO) communications can be used depending on the communication environment. Motivated by the complementary nature of RF and FSO communication, we propose a hybrid RF/FSO transmission strategy for SatCom, where the satellite selects RF or FSO links depending on the weather conditions obtained from sensors and used for the context-awareness. To quantify the performance of the proposed network, we derive the outage probability (OP) expressions by considering different weather conditions. Moreover, asymptotic analysis is conducted to obtain the diversity order. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of non-zero boresight pointing errors and illustrate the benefits of the aperture averaging to mitigate the effect of misalignment and atmospheric turbulence. Finally, we suggest effective design guidelines that can be useful for system designers. The results have shown that the proposed strategy performs better than the dual-mode conventional hybrid RF/FSO communication in terms of OP offering some power gain.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Non-terrestrial network (NTN), especially HighAltitude Platform Station (HAPS), is a popular choice because of low latency, deployment flexibility, and disaster resilience. In order to increase the availability of HAPS, a new multiple access system that improves performance, such as throughput and user fairness, is required. Although Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is a promising technology for improving spectral efficiency, there are significant differences in transmission rate according to power levels for NOMA. Since ground-HAPS links are the end part of NTN and the HAPS network is expected to be used for the mobile network, the user fairness of NOMA should be improved. Thus, to increase throughput guaranteeing user fairness and transmission accuracy for HAPS, we implement Power Level Division Multiple Access (PDMA) which power levels of users are randomly switched in each timeslot. In this paper, we propose a new system applying PDMA for ground-HAPS uplink network with hybrid Free Space Optics (FSO) / millimeter wave communication. In our system, it switches optical and millimeter waves according to the channel state of users. By simulation results, the throughput of PDMA is higher than that of Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), and its user fairness is significantly improved compared with NOMA.},

  abstract={Integrating terrestrial networks with burgeoning high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) will be a disruptive challenge for beyond-5G systems provisioning large-scale three-dimensional connectivity. Here, we study the problem of forwarding packets between terrestrial terminals and backhaul through multi-HAPS relaying. Considering the limited wireless backhaul, which is the practical constraint of HAPS relaying, dual-hop mixed radiofrequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) networks are investigated, where backhaul-to-relay and relay-to-user communications employ FSO and RF links, respectively. To maximize the end-to-end network throughput, including downlink and uplink rate, we formulate the optimization problem for variables; the association between aerial and terrestrial terminals, transmit power, and deployment of multiple HAPSs, respectively. We tackle this problem using an iterative algorithm with proposed surrogate functions to efficiently obtain the locally optimal solution. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed optimal method achieves up to 11.3% spectral efficiency compared to the conventional heuristic method. Furthermore, we answer three questions; 1) what the wireless backhaul requirements are, 2) how the number of HAPSs and terrestrial terminals impact the network, and 3) what if a certain user terminal has a particular demand on data rate.},

  abstract={Integrating low-altitude earth orbit (LEO) satellites (SATs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a non-terrestrial network (NTN), we investigate the problem of forwarding packets between two faraway ground terminals through SAT and UAV relays using either radio-frequency (RF) or free-space optical (FSO) link. Towards maximizing the communication efficiency, the associations with orbiting SATs and the trajectories of UAVs should be optimized, which is challenging due to the time-varying network topology and a huge number of possible control actions. To overcome the difficulty, we lift this problem to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with a novel action dimensionality reduction technique. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed SAT-UAV integrated scheme achieves 1.99x higher end-to-end sum throughput compared to a benchmark scheme with fixed ground relays. While improving the throughput, our proposed scheme also aims to reduce the UAV control energy, yielding 2.25x higher energy efficiency than a baseline method only maximizing the throughput. Lastly, thanks to utilizing hybrid FSO/RF links, the proposed scheme achieves up to 62.56x higher peak throughput and 21.09x higher worst-case throughput than the cases utilizing either RF or FSO links, highlighting the importance of co-designing SAT-UAV associations, UAV trajectories, and hybrid FSO/RF links in beyond-5 G NTNs.},

We propose the use of optical phase-shift keying (QPSK) signaling and dual-threshold/heterodyne detection (DT/HD) receivers to bolster the reliability and feasibility of satellite EB/CV-QKD/FSO systems. Closed-form expressions for key system performance metrics are derived using improved channel modeling.

  abstract={Considering many advancements in aerial platform technology, aerial backhaul networks (ABNs) are expected to play a big role in 6th generation (6G) mobile systems. Considering the significant demand in capacity of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, ABNs using free space optical (FSO) signals are receiving attention as an alternative to using traditional radio frequency (RF) signals. However, FSO based ABNs face the challenge of needing to avoid obstacles (e.g., clouds) in the vertical channel to maintain line-of-sight (LoS) between the ground terminals (GTs) and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs). Therefore, in this paper, a trajectory optimized FSO based UAV-IoT (U-IoT) backhaul network (TOFU) scheme that minimizes the end-to-end outage probability is proposed. Considering moving clouds and obstacles, the TOFU scheme identifies the changing LoS area and applies gradient descent based on optimized control of the HAP and relay UAVs to minimize the end-to-end outage probability. Simulation experiments were conducted to include various cloud properties and orientations, where the results show that the TOFU scheme can provide significant improvements in the end-to-end outage probability and throughput compared to other benchmarked schemes.},

  pages={106451-106458},
  abstract={This study proposes an adaptive thresholding optical detection technique using a stochastic approximation (SA) to enhance receiver performance in multi-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) based free-space optical (FSO) transmission. When the receiver detects the symbol by fixed threshold decision (FTD) scheme, the detection performance of high order modulation, including PAM4, becomes degraded due to a random fluctuation of the received signal. Owing to the slow varying characteristic of atmospheric turbulence, we used an adaptive linear prediction (ALP) filter to predict the decision threshold of the upcoming frame. The experiment was conducted on various degrees of turbulence channels. A Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) based turbulence channel emulator was used to experimentally investigate the turbulence-induced scintillation effect. The experiment results confirmed that the proposed technique yielded improved receiver performance compared to FTD. In the case of considering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise of erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), the adaptive threshold decision (ATD) scheme obtained about 3dB gain compared with an even-valued threshold (EVT) decision scheme when the average EDFA input optical power was below -16dBm.},

  abstract={The integrated use of non-terrestrial network (NTN) entities such as the high-altitude platform station (HAPS) and low-altitude platform station (LAPS) has become essential elements in the space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, the complexity, mobility, and heterogeneity of NTN entities and resources present various challenges from system design to deployment. This paper proposes a novel approach to designing a heterogeneous network consisting of HAPSs and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being LAPS entities. Our approach involves jointly optimizing the three-dimensional trajectory and channel allocation for aerial base stations, with a focus on ensuring fairness and the provision of quality of service (QoS) to ground users. Furthermore, we consider the load on base stations and incorporate this information into the optimization problem. The proposed approach utilizes a combination of deep reinforcement learning and fixed-point iteration techniques to determine the UAV locations and channel allocation strategies. Simulation results reveal that our proposed deep learning-based approach significantly outperforms learning-based and conventional benchmark models.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={By exploiting the degree of freedom on the altitude, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication can provide ubiquitous communication for future wireless networks. In the case of concurrent transmission of multiple UAVs, the directional beamforming formed by multiple antennas is an effective way to reduce co-channel interference. However, factors such as airflow disturbance or estimation error for UAV communications can cause the occurrence of beam misalignment. In this paper, we investigate the system performance of a multi-tier UAV communication network with the consideration of unstable beam alignment. In particular, we propose a tractable random model to capture the impacts of beam misalignment in the 3D space. Based on this, by utilizing stochastic geometry, an analytical framework for obtaining the outage probability in the downlink of a multi-tier UAV communication network for the closest distance association scheme and the maximum average power association scheme is established. The accuracy of the analysis is verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. The results indicate that in the presence of random beam misalignment, the optimal number of UAV antennas needs to be adjusted to be relatively larger when the density of UAVs increases or the altitude of UAVs becomes higher.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to bring new opportunities for improving several services for the Society, from transportation to agriculture, from smart cities to fleet management. In this framework, massive connectivity represents one of the key issues. This is especially relevant when IoT systems are expected to cover a large geographical area or a region not reached by terrestrial network connections. In such scenarios, the usage of satellites might represent a viable solution for providing wide area coverage and connectivity in a flexible and affordable manner. Our paper presents a survey on current solutions for the deployment of IoT services in remote/rural areas by exploiting satellites. Several architectures and technical solutions are analyzed, underlining their features and limitations, and real test cases are presented. It has been highlighted that low-orbit satellites offer an efficient solution to support long-range IoT services, with a good trade-off in terms of coverage and latency. Moreover, open issues, new challenges, and innovative technologies have been focused, carefully considering the perimeter that current IoT standardization framework will impose to the practical implementation of future satellite based IoT systems.},

  abstract={Nonterrestrial communications have emerged as a key enabler for seamless connectivity in the upcoming generation networks. This kind of network can support high data rate communications among aerial platforms (i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites) and cellular networks, achieving anywhere and anytime connections. However, there are many practical implementation limitations, especially overload power consumption, high probability of blockage, and dynamic propagation environment. Fortunately, the recent technology reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is expected to be one of the most cost-efficient solutions to address such issues. RIS with low-cost elements can bypass blockages and create multiple line-of-sight (LoS) links and provide controllable communication channels. In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review on the RIS-assisted nonterrestrial networks (RANTNs). First, the framework of the RANTNs is introduced with detailed discussion about distinct properties of RIS in NTNs and the two deployment types of RIS, that is, terrestrial RISs (TRISs), and aerial RISs (ARISs), and the classification of RANTNs, including RIS-assisted air-to-ground (A2G)/ground-to-air (G2A), ARIS-assisted ground-to-ground (G2G), and RIS-assisted air-to-air (A2A) communications. In combination with next-generation communication technologies, the advanced technologies in RANTNs are discussed. Then, we overview the literature related to RANTNs from the perspectives of performance analysis and optimization, followed by the widely used methodologies. Finally, open challenges and future research direction in the context of the RANTNs are highlighted.},

  abstract={The next phase of satellite technology is being characterized by a new evolution in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites, which conveys exciting new communication capabilities to provide non-terrestrial connectivity solutions and to support a wide range of digital technologies from various industries. NGSO communication systems are known for a number of key features such as lower propagation delay, smaller size, and lower signal losses in comparison to the conventional geostationary orbit (GSO) satellites, which can potentially enable latency-critical applications to be provided through satellites. NGSO promises a substantial boost in communication speed and energy efficiency, and thus, tackling the main inhibiting factors of commercializing GSO satellites for broader utilization. The promised improvements of NGSO systems have motivated this paper to provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art NGSO research focusing on the communication prospects, including physical layer and radio access technologies along with the networking aspects and the overall system features and architectures. Beyond this, there are still many NGSO deployment challenges to be addressed to ensure seamless integration not only with GSO systems but also with terrestrial networks. These unprecedented challenges are also discussed in this paper, including coexistence with GSO systems in terms of spectrum access and regulatory issues, satellite constellation and architecture designs, resource management problems, and user equipment requirements.

  abstract={Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks (SatNets) are envisioned to play a crucial role in providing global and ubiquitous connectivity efficiently. Accordingly, in the coming years, thousands of LEO satellites will be launched to create ultra- dense LEO mega-constellations, and the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is working on evolving fifth-generation (5G) systems to support such non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, many challenges are associated with the deployment of LEOs from communications and networking perspectives. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) based architecture for future ultra-dense LEO SatNets. We discuss various aspects of network design, such as duplexing mode, pilot assignment, beamforming, and handover management. In addition, we propose a joint optimization framework for the power allocation and handover management processes to maximize the network throughput and minimize the handover rate while ensuring quality-of-service (QoS) satisfaction for users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce and study CF-mMIMO- based LEO SatNets. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed architecture and solutions compared to those of conventional single-satellite connectivity and handover techniques from the literature.},

An approximate ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) expression is derived when the atmosphere turbulence and pointing error due to the characteristics of THz as well as the phase errors resulting from finite precision of RIS and imperfect channel estimation are taken into account simultaneously. Furthermore, according to the statistical and perfect channel state information of the untrustworthy receiver, we optimize the phase shifts of RIS to maximize the lower bound of secrecy rate (SR) and instantaneous SR, respectively, by using semidefinite relaxation method. Simulation results show that both the approximate expression for the ESR and the optimization algorithms are serviceable, and even when the jitter standard variance of the trustworthy receiver is greater than that of the untrustworthy one, a positive SR can still be guaranteed.},

  abstract={As of today, the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system has been rolled out in many countries and the number of 5G subscribers already reaches a very large scale. It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of “Is there any need for 6G?” by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of “What 6G may look like?.” This survey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and further investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G communications systems.},

  abstract={Owing to the explosive growth of requirements of rapid emergency communication response and accurate observation services, airborne communication networks (ACNs) have received much attention from both industry and academia. ACNs are subject to heterogeneous networks that are engineered to utilize satellites, high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and low-altitude platforms (LAPs) to build communication access platforms. Compared to terrestrial wireless networks, ACNs are characterized by frequently changed network topologies and more vulnerable communication connections. Furthermore, ACNs have the demand for the seamless integration of heterogeneous networks such that the network quality-of-service (QoS) can be improved. Thus, designing mechanisms and protocols for ACNs poses many challenges. To solve these challenges, extensive research has been conducted. The objective of this special issue is to disseminate the contributions in the field of ACNs. To present this special issue with the necessary background and offer an overall view of this field, three key areas of ACNs are covered. Specifically, this paper covers LAP-based communication networks, HAP-based communication networks, and integrated ACNs. For each area, this paper addresses the particular issues and reviews major mechanisms. This paper also points out future research directions and challenges.},

  abstract={A High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) is a network node that operates in the stratosphere at an of altitude around 20 km and is instrumental for providing communication services. Precipitated by technological innovations in the areas of autonomous avionics, array antennas, solar panel efficiency levels, and battery energy densities, and fueled by flourishing industry ecosystems, the HAPS has emerged as an indispensable component of next-generations of wireless networks. In this article, we provide a vision and framework for the HAPS networks of the future supported by a comprehensive and state-of-the-art literature review. We highlight the unrealized potential of HAPS systems and elaborate on their unique ability to serve metropolitan areas. The latest advancements and promising technologies in the HAPS energy and payload systems are discussed. The integration of the emerging Reconfigurable Smart Surface (RSS) technology in the communications payload of HAPS systems for providing a cost-effective deployment is proposed. A detailed overview of the radio resource management in HAPS systems is presented along with synergistic physical layer techniques, including Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. Numerous aspects of handoff management in HAPS systems are described. The notable contributions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in HAPS, including machine learning in the design, topology management, handoff, and resource allocation aspects are emphasized. The extensive overview of the literature we provide is crucial for substantiating our vision that depicts the expected deployment opportunities and challenges in the next 10 years (next-generation networks), as well as in the subsequent 10 years (next-next-generation networks).},

  abstract={The next frontier towards truly ubiquitous connectivity is the use of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) small-satellite constellations to support 5G and Beyond-5G (B5G) networks. Besides enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC), LEO constellations can support ultra-reliable communications (URC) with relaxed latency requirements of a few tens of milliseconds. Small-satellite impairments and the use of low orbits pose major challenges to the design and performance of these networks, but also open new innovation opportunities.

  abstract={The explosive growth of various services boosts the innovation and development in terrestrial communication systems for the implementation of the next generation mobile communication networks. However, simply utilizing limited resources in terrestrial communication networks is difficult to support the massive quality of service (QoS) aware requirements and it is hard to guarantee seamless coverage in far remote regions. Leveraging the intrinsic merits of high altitude and the ability of multicasting or broadcasting, satellite communication systems provide an opportunity for novel mobile communication networks with its tight interaction and complementary characteristics to traditional terrestrial networks. It is believed that the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks can solve the problems existing in current mobile communication systems and make a profound effect on global information dissemination. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey on the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks. First, motivations and requirements of satellite-terrestrial network convergence are identified. Then, we summarize related architectures of existing literature, classify the taxonomy of researches on satellite-terrestrial networks, and present the performance evaluation works in different satellite-terrestrial networks. After that, the state-of-the-art of standardization, projects and the key application areas of satellite-terrestrial networks are also reviewed. Finally, we conclude the survey by highlighting the open issues and future directions.},

  abstract={Fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems have entered the stage of commercial deployment, providing users with new services, improved user experiences as well as a host of novel opportunities to various industries. However, 5G still faces many challenges. To address these challenges, international industrial, academic, and standards organizations have commenced research on sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. A series of white papers and survey papers have been published, which aim to define 6G in terms of requirements, application scenarios, key technologies, etc. Although ITU-R has been working on the 6G vision and it is expected to reach a consensus on what 6G will be by mid-2023, the related global discussions are still wide open and the existing literature has identified numerous open issues. This paper first provides a comprehensive portrayal of the 6G vision, technical requirements, and application scenarios, covering the current common understanding of 6G. Then, a critical appraisal of the 6G network architecture and key technologies is presented. Furthermore, existing testbeds and advanced 6G verification platforms are detailed for the first time. In addition, future research directions and open challenges are identified to stimulate the on-going global debate. Finally, lessons learned to date concerning 6G networks are discussed.},

Remote connectivity, however, would have benefited from a more inclusive consideration in the existing generations of mobile communications. To remedy this, sustainability and its social impact are being positioned as key drivers of the sixth generation's (6G) research and standardization activities. In particular, there has been a conscious attempt to understand the demands of remote wireless connectivity, which has led to a better understanding of the challenges that lie ahead.

  abstract={The ultra-dense deployment of interconnected satellites will characterize future low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations. Exploiting this towards a more efficient satellite network (SatNet), this paper proposes a novel LEO SatNet architecture based on distributed massive multiple-input multipleoutput (DM-MIMO) technology allowing ground user terminals to be connected to a cluster of satellites. To this end, we investigate various aspects of DM-MIMO-based satellite network design, the benefits of using this architecture, the associated challenges, and the potential solutions. In addition, we propose a distributed joint power allocation and handover management (D-JPAHM) technique that jointly optimizes the power allocation and handover management processes in a cross-layer manner. This framework aims to maximize the network throughput and minimize the handover rate while considering the quality-of-service (QoS) demands of user terminals and the power capabilities of the satellites. Moreover, we devise an artificial intelligence (AI)-based solution to efficiently implement the proposed D-JPAHM framework in a manner suitable for real-time operation and the dynamic SatNet environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce and study DM-MIMO technology in LEO SatNets. Extensive simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed architecture and solutions compared to conventional approaches in the literature.},

However, the traditional access-based approach to satellite operations cannot meet the pressing requirements of real-time, reliable, and resilient operations for LEO satellites. A new scheme is proposed based on multi-layer satellite networking considering the advanced Ka-band and optical communications payloads on a satellite platform. The proposed scheme can enable efficient and resilient message transmissions for critical telecommand and telemetry missions through different layers of satellite networks, which consist of LEO, medium-Earth-orbit (MEO), and geostationary (GEO) satellites. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a 24-hr satellite mission and shows superior performance improvements compared to the traditional operations approach.},

  year={2023},
  volume={18},

  pages={20-28},
  abstract={The high-altitude platform station (HAPS) concept has recently received notable attention from both industry and academia to support future wireless networks. A HAPS can be equipped with fifth-generation (5G) and beyond technologies such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Hence, it is expected that HAPS will support numerous applications in both rural and urban areas. However, this comes at the expense of high energy consumption and thus shorter loitering time. To tackle this issue, we envision the use of a multimode HAPS that can adaptively switch among different modes so as to reduce energy consumption and extend the HAPS loitering time. These modes comprise a HAPS super macro base station (HAPS-SMBS) mode for enhanced computing, caching, and communication services; a HAPS relay station (HAPS-RS) mode for active communication; and a HAPS-RIS mode for passive communication. This multimode HAPS ensures that operations rely mostly on the passive communication payload, while switching to an energy-greedy active mode only when necessary. In this article, we begin with a brief review of HAPS features compared with other nonterrestrial systems, followed by an exposition of the different HAPS modes proposed. Subsequently, we illustrate the envisioned multimode HAPS and discuss its benefits and challenges. Finally, we validate the multimode efficiency through a case study.},

  title={Broadband Connectivity for Handheld Devices via LEO Satellites: Is Distributed Massive MIMO the Answer?}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={4},
  number={},
  pages={713-726},
  abstract={Significant efforts are being made to integrate satellite and terrestrial networks into a unified wireless network. One major aspect of such an integration is the use of unified user terminals (UTs), which work for both networks and can switch seamlessly between them. However, supporting broadband connectivity for handheld UTs directly from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is very challenging due to link budget reasons. This paper proposes using distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (DM-MIMO) techniques to improve the data rates of handheld devices with a view to supporting their broadband connectivity by exploiting the ultra-dense deployment of LEO satellites and high-speed inter-satellite links. In this regard, we discuss DM-MIMO-based satellite networks from different perspectives, including the channel model, network management, and architecture. In addition, we evaluate the performance of such networks theoretically by deriving closed-form expressions for spectral efficiency and using extensive simulations based on actual data from a Starlink constellation. The performance is compared with that of collocated massive MIMO connectivity (CMMC) and single-satellite connectivity (SSC) scenarios. The simulation results validate the analytical results and show the superior performance of DM-MIMO-based techniques compared to CMMC and SSC modes for improving the data rates of individual users.},

  abstract={It is a key challenge and obligation for future networks to deliver high-quality wireless for enabling novel services and application to flourish for the benefit of humans on a personal level, for society as a whole, as well as for business and innovation. The dynamics, as well as the heterogeneity of the foreseen 6G system in terms of communication technologies, frequencies used, management frameworks, etc. make the need for flexibility of utmost importance. Although several steps are being made to this direction, flexible networks, capable of dynamically adapting to changes, (re)configuring themselves, exploiting highly dynamic resources in terms of availability in a three- dimensional network space is still a challenge from different perspectives. This paper identifies the key challenges, technical enablers, as well as current efforts towards the realization of the 3D, flexible 6G “network of networks” concept.},

This chapter explores three visionary applications of 6G, namely, metaverse, space communication, and deep&#x2010;sea tourism. The concept of metaverse refers to a universal virtual environment parallel to the physical world to facilitate realistic interactions. 6G is expected to accelerate the growth of metaverse. Deep&#x2010;sea explorations involve the investigating the bed of the ocean for research, commercial, or entertainment purposes. The recent developments of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled UAV&#x2010;assisted mobile relay communication to facilitate maritime communication applications.

  abstract={This paper proposes learning-based joint optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) reflection coefficients in UAV-RIS-assisted cognitive non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) to enhance the secrecy performance. The practical RIS phase shift model, outdated channel state information (CSI) and interference from neighboring satellites are considered. We introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve the UAV trajectory optimization problem to enhance the gain from RIS. Furthermore, we propose a double cascade correlation network (DCCN) to adjust the RIS reflection coefficients in UAV trajectory optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the secrecy performance in UAV-RIS-assisted cognitive NTNs.},

  abstract={The ever-increasing demand for wireless communication has driven the development of innovative technologies to address the issues that conventional communication networks meet. To support autonomous devices in the sixth-generation (6G) and provide seamless wireless connectivity in inaccessible and hard-to-reach areas, the combination of software-defined networking (SDN) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has already shown promises. As the traditional UAV-based cellular network encompasses challenges such as lack of centralized supervision, robust decision-making ability, and dynamic network management, the SDN platform could be an excellent alternative to offer aerial networking for future 6G ecosystem. However, the SDN-assisted UAV paradigm faces a set of challenges and critical issues. For instance, the network management and orchestration, resource allocation and optimization, handover mechanism, spectrum management, energy efficiency, integration of heterogeneous networks, and reliability, thus causing the decrease of quality of services of the SDN-enables UAV networks. To effectively address all these issues and identify the trends of software-defined UAV (SDUAV) networks, more research activities are needed. Unfortunately, there are not any specific guidelines in the literature that address each of these requirements, enabling technologies, emerging techniques, and future research directions in the context of SDN-based UAV networks to enable next-generation 6G systems. Therefore, motivated by this fact, this paper offers a comprehensive evaluation of the state of the SDUAV network and architecture, highlighting its various requirements and different prospects and applications in 6G systems. Besides, this paper also addresses why the combination of SDN and UAV-enabled networks is becoming essential in the 6G networking context and how it can offer more flexibility, scalability, reliability, and efficient connectivity than the conventional approaches to provide features like intelligence, automation, programmability, and centralized controllability. This paper furthermore outlines the difficulties of implementing SDUAV networks, such as security, adaptability, interference management, interoperability, and lack of standardization. Finally, to accomplish the goals, this article provides a roadmap for future trends and research directions in SDUAV networks to support the 6G systems.},
