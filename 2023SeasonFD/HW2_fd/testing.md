# Understanding Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely employed in various fields, including economics, finance, and data science, to make predictions and analyze data. In this blog post, we will delve into the basics of linear regression.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (also called the dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, which means that changes in the independent variables are associated with a constant change in the dependent variable.

## Simple Linear Regression

In simple linear regression, we have one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y). The relationship can be expressed by the equation:
